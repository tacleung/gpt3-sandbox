# **Wildfire Risk Mitigation Report for Fetzer Wineries**

**Client:** Bonterra Organic (Fetzer Wineries)  
**Location:** 12901 Old River Road, Hopland, CA 95449  
**Date of Inspection:** September 15, 2024  
**Inspector:** FireBreak Solutions, Inc.  
**Address:** 344 Thomas L. Berkley Way, Oakland, CA 94612

## **Overview**

Based on FireBreak’s visual observations and the Fetzer team’s explanations of maintenance practices, the Fetzer Wineries facility meets the criteria for preferred rates under the BMS-Chaucer wildfire insurance program. This report includes detailed findings, grades, and recommendations from the **FireBreak Wildfire Mitigation Scoring Model**. Key grades and statuses from the scoring spreadsheet are summarized below for at-a-glance reference.

| Category              | Current Grade | Potential Grade (With Remediation) |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| **Defensible Space**  | B             | A                                  |
| **Location Hardening**| B             | A                                  |

*Note*: The table above provides a quick view of where Fetzer’s current risk profile stands and potential improvements achievable with remediation. It is designed to aid underwriters and incentivize improvements.

## **Appreciations and Positive Aspects**

- **Proactive Risk Management**: Fetzer’s approach goes above industry standards, demonstrating proactive and thorough site management.
- **Tank Anchorage Inspection**: The report includes a structural check on tank anchoring, a valuable addition for earthquake preparedness.
- **Labelled Site and Photo Maps**: Clearly labeled site maps provide building identification, which most insured sites lack. The photo location map offers the opportunity for consistent year-over-year comparisons if photos are taken from the same locations in future reports.
- **Detailed Checklist Completion**: FireBreak’s checklist is based on our application form, offering valuable information for underwriting. For future wineries, FireBreak will receive our completed application form before the site visit, making it easier and faster to verify details and fill in any blanks.

## **Summary of Findings**

### Defensible Space
- **5' Ember Zone**: All five-foot ember zones around buildings are well-maintained. Planned mitigation actions are in place to remove combustibles and vegetation where necessary.
- **Vegetation and Trees**: Vegetation on the west slope and south side of the White Barrel Room requires scheduled clearing. Trees on the west side of the Red Barrel Room should be removed.
- **Combustibles**: Controlled pallet storage in the Production Facility includes sprinklers to mitigate risk.

### Location Hardening
- **Roofing and Eaves**: All roofs are constructed from non-combustible metal with enclosed eaves, except for some wooden eave sections in the Production Facility.
- **Openings (Vents, Doors, Windows, Skylights)**: The majority of vents, doors, and windows conform to wildfire-resistant standards. Some windows in the White Barrel Room are single-paned, and it is recommended to verify the fire resistance of skylights in the Winery as part of future maintenance.

## **Recommendations and Action Points**

### **Immediate Recommendations** (To meet high wildfire risk standards)
- **Determine Skylight Material**: Conduct a material assessment of skylights in the Winery to confirm their fire resistance.
- **Tree Removal**: Complete removal of trees on the west side of the Red Barrel Room as scheduled.

### **Action Points** (Long-term improvements, not critical)
- **Remove Vegetation Near White Barrel Room**: Although this building is not used for wine production, removing shrubs on the west and south sides will reduce fire risk.
- **Consider Upgrading Single-Paned Windows**: In the White Barrel Room, replace accessible single-paned windows with fire-resistant alternatives as part of future upgrades.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Future Reports**: Use photo maps to capture comparative images from the same angles year-over-year.
- **Terminology Update**: Reference "Location Hardening" instead of "Home Hardening" throughout the scoring model and related documentation.

This structured, comprehensive approach aligns with Chaucer’s feedback and provides actionable insights to achieve wildfire risk mitigation goals effectively.
